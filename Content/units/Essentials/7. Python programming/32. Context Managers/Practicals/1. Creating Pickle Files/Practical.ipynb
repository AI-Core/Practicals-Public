    "# Creating Pickle Files\n",
    "\n",
    "A pickle file in Python is a file type used to store complex data structures such as lists, dictionaries, or custom objects in a way that can be loaded back into a Python program while maintaining their original structure and data type.  You can read more about them [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data in a pickle file are stored as binary information. This means that to read and write from them, we will need to use the `rb` (read binary) and `wb` (write binary) modes with our `open()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code block below, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the `pickle` library\n",
    "2. Create a dictionary called `my_dict` with the keys `a`, `b`, and `c` and the values `1`, `2`, and `3`\n",
    "3. Create a context manager that opens a file called `my_dict.pkl` in write-binary mode and writes `my_dict` to the file. You will need to use the `pickle.dump(variable_to_save, file_handle)` method to write data to a pickle file. The `file_handle` parameter is the name of the temporary variable you use to address the file you are opening, after the `as` keyword in the context manager statement.\n"
